#Pull Request Solver by Devin Grischow

#To Add this code to your project, selecting the PROJECT, press add new file to create a file at the ROOT,
#Then make a EMPTY file, and name it the .gitignore


#This bit of code/rules is designed to help SOLVE the pull/merges/ pull requests and saying there is conflicting files, 99% of the time it comes from this file saying something that there is conflict in side.
#This is due to small changes like function renaming, file names, groups, etc.




#common issues come from merging files both users have but werent included, all the files that can cause the most issues are here.

#Commonly its the users files (like breakpoints, bookmarks, etc) Cause the Most Bugs


#BEST PRACTICE FOR SWITCHING BRANCHES:


#Never Stach Crucial Changes, or try to avoid caching in general. If Possible Commit At progress and always save. Avoid merging



## Xcode Patch

xcuserdata/
#Ignores the users data settings thats not needed: ex bookmarks, breakpoints, etc

#They will be visible only to Local Users, Best practice is to use Good Documentation



/*.gcno
#Ignores gcno Files from directory, gnco files goverate gcov coverage files, which are results from tests
#ignore these tests in the gitUploads.
